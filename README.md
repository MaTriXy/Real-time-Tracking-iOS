# Real-time-Tracker-iOS
This app has 4 different modes of visualizing object movement with the iPhone's camera in real-time.


#### Compressive Tracking
Touch mode uses a very robust and state-of-the-art tracker designed by Kaihua Zhang, Lei Zhang, and Ming-Hsuan Yang. The [official website](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/CT/CT.htm) has source code, documentation, and additional testing demos.

#### Object Detection
This mode uses background subtraction techniques to locate moving objects in the iPhone camera's view. There is also a mask version of this mode to see where exactly foreground objects appear on top of the background model.

## Requirements
 - iOS 7+
 - Xcode 8.0+
 - Swift 3.0+
